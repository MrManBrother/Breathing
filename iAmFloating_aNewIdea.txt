I don't remember the first time I wrote my name
What I do remember is the first time someone else was called my name
I told him that was my name,
too,
but he couldn't believe it
He was a fat boy with a puffy face
He looked like a little boxer

Now people call me in different names and I don't care
Why people call me other names might be
because I am not writing my name the right way,
though that is how it's written in my documents
Foreheads furrow whenever I say
my name, and I have to
take my papers out and show them for themselves

I sometimes introduce myself as Bob,
but only where I am sure nobody knows me
I have to be careful
or they would know I'm not Bob

Coffee shops are among the places that
I call myself Bob
I sometimes forget I am Bob and
my coffee grows cold
I never go twice to the same coffee shop

Where is this name from? This is
the question that I have to answer
whenever I say my real name
Cab drivers, clerks
I rarely take a cab
Then they tell me they
have a friend who
has the same name
I think about all the people in the world
with my name and their cab driver friends

I dont have friends, and the only one
that I had was not a cab driver or clerk
My name became a different name
in her mouth
I want to say I loved hearing it from her
and maybe I did, but any time I heard it,
I feared I had done something wrong

I wonder how the fat boy writes his name,
and if he, like me, is being called
different names
